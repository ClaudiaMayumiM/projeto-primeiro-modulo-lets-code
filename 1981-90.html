                    <h2>The Final Cut (1983)</h2>
                    <p>
                        In 1982, Waters suggested a project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as
                        the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters
                        changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the
                        invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late
                        father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should
                        include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that
                        Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to
                        the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role
                        traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and
                        Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely
                        maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the
                        credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.

                        Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an
                        experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he
                        remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters
                        choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to
                        number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the
                        music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to
                        delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later
                        commented: "I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to
                        put some duff tracks on The Final Cut." Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with
                        Kurt Loder calling it "a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning masterpiece". Loder
                        viewed The Final Cut as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".

                    <h2> Waters' departure and legal battles </h2>

                    <p>
                        Gilmour recorded his second solo album, About Face, in 1984, and used it to express his feelings
                        about a variety of topics, from the murder of John Lennon to his relationship with Waters. He
                        later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters
                        began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (1984). Wright formed Zee
                        with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason
                        released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Gilmour, Mason, Waters and O'Rourke met for dinner in 1984 to discuss their future. Mason and
                        Gilmour left the restaurant thinking that Pink Floyd could continue after Waters had finished
                        The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, noting that they had had several hiatuses before; however,
                        Waters left believing that Mason and Gilmour had accepted that Pink Floyd were finished. Mason
                        said that Waters later saw the meeting as "duplicity rather than diplomacy", and wrote in his
                        memoir: "Clearly, our communication skills were still troublingly nonexistent. We left the
                        restaurant with diametrically opposed views of what had been decided."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink
                        Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments.
                        O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss
                        him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed
                        Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the
                        band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that
                        Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new
                        albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments
                        would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening
                        to sue him. He went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of
                        the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd "a spent force creatively".

                    <p>
                        When Waters' lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters
                        returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.
                        Gilmour responded with a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist. The
                        sides reached an out-of-court agreement, finalised on Gilmour's houseboat the Astoria on
                        Christmas Eve 1987. In 2013, Waters said he regretted the lawsuit and had failed to appreciate
                        that the Pink Floyd name had commercial value independent of the band members.
                    </p>

                    <h2> A Momentary Lapse of Reason (1987) </h2>

                    <p>
                        In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album
                        without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's
                        re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to
                        participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence "would make us
                        stronger legally and musically", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings
                        of $11,000.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. The
                        group found it difficult to work without Waters' creative direction; to write lyrics, Gilmour
                        worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing
                        Anthony Moore.[200] Wright and Mason were out of practice; Gilmour said they had been "destroyed
                        by Roger", and their contributions were minimal.

                    <p>
                        A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative
                        input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that
                        Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since
                        Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: "I think
                        it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's
                        lyrics are third-rate." Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's
                        top form, Wright disagreed, stating: "Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at
                        all." Q magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.

                    <p>
                        Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US
                        and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the
                        start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the
                        upcoming tour were chaotic, with Mason and Wright entirely out of practice. Realising he had
                        taken on too much work, Gilmour asked Ezrin to assist them. As Pink Floyd toured North America,
                        Waters' Radio K.A.O.S. tour was on occasion, close by, though in much smaller venues than those
                        hosting his former band's performances. Waters issued a writ for copyright fees for the band's
                        use of the flying pig. Pink Floyd responded by attaching a large set of male genitalia to its
                        underside to distinguish it from Waters' design. The parties reached a legal agreement on 23
                        December; Mason and Gilmour retained the right to use the Pink Floyd name in perpetuity and
                        Waters received exclusive rights to, among other things, The Wall.
