                    <h2>Atom Heart Mother (1970)</h2>

                    <img src="imagens/1970 atom heart mother-2.jpeg" alt="atom heart mother">

                    <p>
                        In October 1970, Pink Floyd released Atom Heart Mother. An early version premièred in England in
                        mid January, but disagreements over the mix prompted the hiring of Ron Geesin to work out the
                        sound problems. Geesin
                        worked to improve the score, but with little creative input from the band, production was
                        troublesome.
                        Geesin eventually completed the project with the aid of John Alldis, who was the director of the
                        choir hired
                        to perform on the record. Smith earned an executive producer credit, and the album marked his
                        final official
                        contribution to the band's discography. Gilmour said it was "A neat way of saying that he didn't
                        ... do
                        anything". Waters was critical of Atom Heart Mother, claiming that he would prefer if it were
                        "thrown into
                        the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again". Gilmour once described it as "a load of
                        rubbish",
                        stating: "I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period." Pink Floyd's first number-
                        one album,
                        Atom Heart Mother was hugely successful in Britain, spending 18 weeks on the UK chart. It
                        premièred at the
                        Bath Festival on 27 June 1970.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pink Floyd toured extensively across America and Europe in 1970. In 1971, Pink Floyd took second
                        place in a
                        reader's poll, in Melody Maker, and for the first time were making a profit. Mason and Wright
                        became fathers
                        and bought homes in London while Gilmour, still single, moved to a 19th-century farm in Essex.
                        Waters
                        installed a home recording studio at his house in Islington in a converted toolshed at the back
                        of his
                        garden. In January 1971, upon their return from touring Atom Heart Mother, Pink Floyd began
                        working on new
                        material. Lacking a central theme, they attempted several unproductive experiments; engineer
                        John Leckie
                        described the sessions as often beginning in the afternoon and ending early the next morning,
                        "during which
                        time nothing would get [accomplished]. There was no record company contact whatsoever, except
                        when their
                        label manager would show up now and again with a couple of bottles of wine and a couple of
                        joints". The band
                        spent long periods working on basic sounds, or a guitar riff. They also spent several days at
                        Air Studios,
                        attempting to create music using a variety of household objects, a project which would be
                        revisited between
                        The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here.

                    <h2>Meddle (1971)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Released in October 1971, "Meddle not only confirms lead guitarist David Gilmour's emergence as
                        a
                        real
                        shaping force with the group, it states forcefully and accurately that the group is well into
                        the growth
                        track again", wrote Jean-Charles Costa of Rolling Stone. NME called Meddle "an exceptionally
                        good album",
                        singling out "Echoes" as the "Zenith which the Floyd have been striving for". However, Melody
                        Maker's
                        Michael Watts found it underwhelming, calling the album "a soundtrack to a non-existent movie",
                        and
                        shrugging off Pink Floyd as "so much sound and fury, signifying nothing". Meddle is a
                        transitional album
                        between the Barrett-influenced group of the late 1960s and the emerging Pink Floyd. The LP
                        peaked at number
                        3, spending 82 weeks on the UK chart.

                    <h2>The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) </h2>

                    <p>
                        Pink Floyd recorded The Dark Side of the Moon between May 1972 and January 1973 with EMI staff
                        engineer Alan
                        Parsons at Abbey Road. The title is an allusion to lunacy rather than astronomy. The band had
                        composed and
                        refined the material while touring the UK, Japan, North America and Europe. Producer Chris
                        Thomas assisted
                        Parsons. Hipgnosis designed the packaging, which included George Hardie's iconic refracting
                        prism design on
                        the cover. Thorgerson's cover features a beam of white light, representing unity, passing
                        through a prism,
                        which represents society. The refracted beam of coloured light symbolises unity diffracted,
                        leaving an
                        absence of unity. Waters is the sole author of the lyrics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Released in March 1973, the LP became an instant chart success in the UK and throughout Western
                        Europe,
                        earning an enthusiastic response from critics. Each member of Pink Floyd except Wright boycotted
                        the press
                        release of The Dark Side of the Moon because a quadraphonic mix had not yet been completed, and
                        they felt
                        presenting the album through a poor-quality stereo PA system was insufficient. Melody Maker's
                        Roy
                        Hollingworth described side one as "utterly confused ... [and] difficult to follow", but praised
                        side two,
                        writing: "The songs, the sounds ... [and] the rhythms were solid ... [the] saxophone hit the
                        air, the band
                        rocked and rolled". Rolling Stone's Loyd Grossman described it as "a fine album with a textural
                        and
                        conceptual richness that not only invites, but demands involvement."

                        Throughout March 1973, The Dark Side of the Moon featured as part of Pink Floyd's US tour. The
                        album is one
                        of the most commercially successful rock albums of all time; a US number-one, it remained on the
                        Billboard
                        Top LPs & Tape chart for more than fourteen years during the 1970s and 1980s, selling more than
                        45 million
                        copies worldwide. In Britain, the album peaked at number 2, spending 364 weeks on the UK chart.
                        The Dark
                        Side of the Moon is the world's third best-selling album, and the twenty-first best-selling
                        album of all
                        time in the US. The success of the album brought enormous wealth to the members of Pink Floyd.
                        Waters and
                        Wright bought large country houses while Mason became a collector of expensive cars.
                        Disenchanted with their
                        US record company, Capitol Records, Pink Floyd and O'Rourke negotiated a new contract with
                        Columbia Records,
                        who gave them a reported advance of $1,000,000 (US$5,247,638 in 2020 dollars). In Europe, they
                        continued to
                        be represented by Harvest Records.

                    <h2> Wish You Were Here (1975) </h2>

                    <p>
                        After a tour of the UK performing Dark Side, Pink Floyd returned to the studio in January 1975
                        and began
                        work on their ninth studio album, Wish You Were Here. Parsons declined an offer to continue
                        working with
                        them, becoming successful in his own right with the Alan Parsons Project, and so the band turned
                        to Brian
                        Humphries. Initially, they found it difficult to compose new material; the success of The Dark
                        Side of the
                        Moon had left Pink Floyd physically and emotionally drained. Wright later described these early
                        sessions as
                        "falling within a difficult period" and Waters found them "tortuous". Gilmour was more
                        interested in
                        improving the band's existing material. Mason's failing marriage left him in a general malaise
                        and with a
                        sense of apathy, both of which interfered with his drumming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite the lack of creative direction, Waters began to visualise a new concept after several
                        weeks. During
                        1974, Pink Floyd had sketched out three original compositions and had performed them at a series
                        of concerts
                        in Europe. These compositions became the starting point for a new album whose opening four-note
                        guitar
                        phrase, composed purely by chance by Gilmour, reminded Waters of Barrett. The songs provided a
                        fitting
                        summary of the rise and fall of their former bandmate. Waters commented: "Because I wanted to
                        get as close
                        as possible to what I felt ... [that] indefinable, inevitable melancholy about the disappearance
                        of Syd."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While Pink Floyd were working on the album, Barrett made an impromptu visit to the studio.
                        Thorgerson
                        recalled that he "sat round and talked for a bit, but he wasn't really there". He had changed
                        significantly
                        in appearance, so much so that the band did not initially recognise him. Waters was reportedly
                        deeply upset
                        by the experience. Most of Wish You Were Here premiered on 5 July 1975, at an open-air music
                        festival at
                        Knebworth. Released in September, it reached number one in both the UK and the US.

                    <h2>Animals (1977) </h2>

                    <p>
                        In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington
                        and began
                        converting them into a recording studio and storage space, In 1976, they recorded their tenth
                        album,
                        Animals, in
                        their newly finished 24-track studio.The album concept originated with Waters, loosely based on
                        George
                        Orwell's
                        political fable Animal Farm. The lyrics describe different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and
                        sheep.
                        Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging; however, Waters designed the final concept,
                        choosing an image
                        of
                        the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on
                        a per-song
                        basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for "Dogs", which took up almost the entire
                        first side of
                        the
                        album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part "Pigs on the
                        Wing". Wright
                        commented: "It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have
                        something to
                        offer,
                        and only managed to get a couple of things on there." Mason recalled: "Roger was in full flow
                        with the
                        ideas,
                        but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately." Gilmour, distracted by
                        the birth of
                        his
                        first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright
                        contributed much
                        toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also
                        suffering. Animals
                        was
                        the first Pink Floyd album with no writing credit for Wright, who said: "This was when Roger
                        really started
                        to
                        believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we]
                        were still
                        going
                        ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would
                        be me."

                        Released in January 1977, Animals peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at
                        number three. NME
                        described the album as "one of the most extreme, relentless, harrowing and downright
                        iconoclastic hunks of
                        music", and Melody Maker's Karl Dallas called it "[an] uncomfortable taste of reality in a
                        medium that has
                        become in recent years, increasingly soporific".

                        Pink Floyd performed much of Animals during their "In the Flesh" tour. It was their first
                        experience playing
                        large stadiums, whose size caused unease in the band. Waters began arriving at each venue alone,
                        departing
                        immediately after the performance. On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to
                        quit. At the
                        Montreal Olympic Stadium, a group of noisy and enthusiastic fans in the front row of the
                        audience irritated
                        Waters so much that he spat at one of them. The end of the tour marked a low point for Gilmour,
                        who felt
                        that
                        the band achieved the success they had sought, with nothing left for them to accomplish.

                    <p>
                        In July 1978, amid a financial crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented two
                        ideas
                        for Pink
                        Floyd's next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in the Wall;
                        the other
                        later
                        became Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and
                        Gilmour were
                        initially cautious, they chose the former. Bob Ezrin co-produced and wrote a forty-page script
                        for the new
                        album. Ezrin based the story on the central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by
                        Waters' childhood
                        experiences, the most notable of which was the death of his father in World War II. This first
                        metaphorical
                        brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry,
                        eventually
                        transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett.
                        At the end of
                        the
                        album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again
                        becoming a
                        regular
                        and caring person.

                        During the recording of The Wall, the band became dissatisfied with Wright's lack of
                        contribution
                        and fired
                        him.
                        Gilmour said that Wright was dismissed as he "hadn't contributed anything of any value
                        whatsoever to the
                        album—he did very, very little". According to Mason, Wright would sit in on the sessions
                        "without doing
                        anything, just 'being a producer'." Waters said the band agreed that Wright would either have to
                        "have a
                        long
                        battle" or agree to "leave quietly" after the album was finished; Wright accepted the ultimatum
                        and left.

                        The Wall was supported by Pink Floyd's first single since "Money", "Another Brick in the Wall
                        (Part II)",
                        which
                        topped the charts in the US and the UK. The Wall was released on 30 November 1979 and topped the
                        Billboard
                        chart
                        in the US for 15 weeks, reaching number three in the UK. It is tied for sixth most certified
                        album by RIAA,
                        with
                        23 million certified units sold in the US. The cover, with a stark brick wall and band name, was
                        the first
                        Pink
                        Floyd album cover since The Piper at the Gates of Dawn not designed by Hipgnosis.

                        Gerald Scarfe produced a series of animations for the Wall tour. He also commissioned the
                        construction of
                        large
                        inflatable puppets representing characters from the storyline, including the "Mother", the
                        "Ex-wife" and the
                        "Schoolmaster". Pink Floyd used the puppets during their performances. Relationships within the
                        band reached
                        an

                        Waters used
                        his
                        own vehicle to arrive at the venue and stayed in different hotels from the rest of the band.
                        Wright returned
                        as
                        a paid musician, making him the only band member to profit from the tour, which lost about
                        $600,000
                        (US$1,707,980 in 2020 dollars).

                        The Wall was adapted into a film, Pink Floyd – The Wall. The film was conceived as a combination
                        of live
                        concert
                        footage and animated scenes; however, the concert footage proved impractical to film. Alan
                        Parker agreed to
                        direct and took a different approach. The animated sequences remained, but scenes were acted by
                        actors with
                        no
                        dialogue. Waters was screentested, but quickly discarded and they asked Bob Geldof to accept the
                        role of
                        Pink.
                        Geldof was initially dismissive, condemning The Wall's storyline as "bollocks". Eventually won
                        over by the
                        prospect of participation in a significant film and receiving a large payment for his work,
                        Geldof agreed.
                        Screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1982, Pink Floyd – The Wall premièred in the UK in
                        July 1982
