                    <h1><b>1963–1967: Early years</b></h1>
                    <h2>Formation</h2>
                    <p>
                        Roger Waters and Nick Mason met while studying architecture at the London Polytechnic at Regent
                        Street.
                        They first played music together in a group formed by Keith Noble and Clive Metcalfe, fellow
                        students at
                        the school, with Noble's sister Sheilagh. Richard Wright, a fellow architecture student, joined
                        later that year,
                        and the group became a sextet, Sigma 6. Waters played lead guitar, Mason drums, and Wright
                        rhythm guitar (since
                        there was rarely an available keyboard). The band performed at private functions and rehearsed
                        in a tearoom in
                        the basement of the Regent Street Polytechnic. They performed songs by the Searchers and
                        material written by
                        their manager and songwriter, fellow student Ken Chapman.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In September 1963, Waters and Mason moved into a flat at 39 Stanhope Gardens near Crouch End in
                        London,
                        owned by Mike Leonard, a part-time tutor at the nearby Hornsey College of Art and the Regent
                        Street Polytechnic.
                        Mason moved out after the 1964 academic year, and guitarist Bob Klose moved in during September
                        1964, prompting
                        Waters' switch to bass. Sigma 6 went through several names, including the Meggadeaths, the
                        Abdabs and the Screaming
                        Abdabs, Leonard's Lodgers, and the Spectrum Five, before settling on the Tea Set. In 1964, as
                        Metcalfe and Noble
                        left to form their own band, guitarist Syd Barrett joined Klose and Waters at Stanhope Gardens.
                        Barrett, two years
                        younger, had moved to London in 1962 to study at the Camberwell College of Arts. Waters and
                        Barrett were childhood
                        friends; Waters had often visited Barrett and watched him play guitar at Barrett's mother's
                        house. Mason said about
                        Barrett: "In a period when everyone was being cool in a very adolescent, self-conscious way, Syd
                        was unfashionably
                        outgoing; my enduring memory of our first encounter is the fact that he bothered to come up and
                        introduce himself to me."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Noble and Metcalfe left the Tea Set in late 1963, and Klose introduced the band to singer Chris
                        Dennis, a technician with
                        the Royal Air Force (RAF). In December 1964, they secured their first recording time, at a
                        studio in West Hampstead, through
                        one of Wright's friends, who let them use some down time free. Wright, who was taking a break
                        from his studies, did not participate
                        in the session. When the RAF assigned Dennis a post in Bahrain in early 1965, Barrett became the
                        band's frontman. Later that year,
                        they became the resident band at the Countdown Club near Kensington High Street in London, where
                        from late night until early
                        morning they played three sets of 90 minutes each. During this period, spurred by the group's
                        need to extend their sets to minimise
                        song repetition, the band realised that "songs could be extended with lengthy solos", wrote
                        Mason. After pressure from his parents
                        and advice from his college tutors, Klose quit the band in mid-1965 and Barrett took over lead
                        guitar. The group first referred to
                        themselves as the Pink Floyd Sound in late 1965. Barrett created the name on the spur of the
                        moment when he discovered that another
                        band, also called the Tea Set, were to perform at one of their gigs. The name is derived from
                        the given names of two blues musicians
                        whose Piedmont blues records Barrett had in his collection, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council.
                    </p>

                    <img src="imagens/1965-3.jpeg" alt="1965">

                    <p>
                        By 1966, the group's repertoire consisted mainly of rhythm and blues songs and they had begun to
                        receive paid bookings, including
                        a performance at the Marquee Club in December 1966, where Peter Jenner, a lecturer at the London
                        School of Economics, noticed them.
                        Jenner was impressed by the sonic effects Barrett and Wright created, and with his business
                        partner and friend Andrew King became
                        their manager. The pair had little experience in the music industry and used King's inheritance
                        to set up Blackhill Enterprises,
                        purchasing about £1,000 (equivalent to £18,800 in 2019) worth of new instruments and equipment
                        for the band. It was around this
                        time that Jenner suggested they drop the "Sound" part of their band name, thus becoming the Pink
                        Floyd. Under Jenner and King's
                        guidance, the group became part of London's underground music scene, playing at venues including
                        All Saints Hall and the Marquee.
                        While performing at the Countdown Club, the band had experimented with long instrumental
                        excursions, and they began to expand them
                        with rudimentary but effective light shows, projected by coloured slides and domestic lights.
                        Jenner and King's social connections
                        helped gain the band prominent coverage in the Financial Times and an article in the Sunday
                        Times which stated: "At the launching of
                        the new magazine IT the other night a pop group called the Pink Floyd played throbbing music
                        while a series of bizarre coloured shapes
                        flashed on a huge screen behind them ... apparently very psychedelic."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 1966, the band strengthened their business relationship with Blackhill Enterprises, becoming
                        equal partners with Jenner and King and
                        the band members each holding a one-sixth share. By late 1966, their set included fewer R&B
                        standards and more Barrett originals, many
                        of which would be included on their first album. While they had significantly increased the
                        frequency of their performances, the band
                        were still not widely accepted. Following a performance at a Catholic youth club, the owner
                        refused to pay them, claiming that their
                        performance was not music. When their management filed suit in a small claims court against the
                        owner of the youth organisation, a local
                        magistrate upheld the owner's decision. The band was much better received at the UFO Club in
                        London, where they began to build a fan base.
                        Barrett's performances were enthusiastic, "leaping around ... madness ... improvisation ...
                        [inspired] to get past his limitations and into areas that were ... very interesting. Which none
                        of the others could do", wrote biographer Nicholas Schaffner.

                    <h2>Signing with EMI</h2>

                    <p>
                        In 1967, Pink Floyd began to attract the attention of the music industry. While in
                        negotiations with record companies, IT co-founder and UFO club manager Joe Boyd and Pink Floyd's
                        booking agent Bryan Morrison arranged and funded a recording session at Sound Techniques in West
                        Hampstead. Three days later, Pink Floyd signed with EMI, receiving a £5,000 advance (equivalent
                        to
                        £91,400 in 2019). EMI released the band's first single, "Arnold Layne", with the B-side "Candy
                        and a
                        Currant Bun", on 10 March 1967 on its Columbia label.Both tracks were recorded on 29 January
                        1967.
                        "Arnold Layne"'s references to cross-dressing led to a ban by several radio stations; however,
                        creative manipulation by the retailers who supplied sales figures to the music business meant
                        that
                        the single peaked in the UK at number 20.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        EMI-Columbia released Pink Floyd's second single, "See Emily Play", on 16 June 1967. It fared
                        slightly better than "Arnold Layne", peaking at number 6 in the UK. The band performed on the
                        BBC's
                        Look of the Week, where Waters and Barrett, erudite and engaging, faced tough questioning from
                        Hans
                        Keller. They appeared on the BBC's Top of the Pops, a popular programme that controversially
                        required artists to mime their singing and playing. Though Pink Floyd returned for two more
                        performances, by the third, Barrett had begun to unravel, and around this time the band first
                        noticed significant changes in his behaviour. By early 1967, he was regularly using LSD, and
                        Mason
                        described him as "completely distanced from everything going on".
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</h2>

                    <p>
                        Morrison and EMI producer Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract. As part
                        of the deal, the band agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason
                        recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was
                        unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at
                        the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK
                        charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to
                        draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing
                        serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase,
                        but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: "I
                        found [Barrett] in the dressing room and he was so ... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his
                        feet, [and] we got him out to the stage ... The band started to play and Syd just stood there.
                        He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Forced to cancel Pink Floyd's appearance at the prestigious National Jazz and Blues Festival, as
                        well as several other shows, King informed the music press that Barrett was suffering from
                        nervous exhaustion. Waters arranged a meeting with psychiatrist R. D. Laing, and though Waters
                        personally drove Barrett to the appointment, Barrett refused to come out of the car. A stay in
                        Formentera with Sam Hutt, a doctor well established in the underground music scene, led to no
                        visible improvement. The band followed a few concert dates in Europe during September with their
                        first tour of the US in October. As the US tour went on, Barrett's condition grew steadily
                        worse. During appearances on the Dick Clark and Pat Boone shows in November, Barrett confounded
                        his hosts by giving terse answers to questions (or not responding at all) and staring into
                        space. He refused to move his lips when it came time to mime "See Emily Play" on Boone's show.
                        After these embarrassing episodes, King ended their US visit and immediately sent them home to
                        London. Soon after their return, they supported Jimi Hendrix during a tour of England; however,
                        Barrett's depression worsened as the tour continued.

                    <h2>Transition and international success </h2>

                    <h2>1967: Replacement of Barrett by Gilmour</h2>

                    <p>
                        In December 1967, reaching a crisis point with Barrett, Pink Floyd added guitarist David Gilmour
                        as the fifth member. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in
                        the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and
                        later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of
                        Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary
                        of £30 per week (equivalent to £500 in 2019). In January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced
                        Gilmour as the band's newest member, intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming
                        songwriter. According to Jenner, the group planned that Gilmour would "cover for [Barrett's]
                        eccentricities". When this proved unworkable, it was decided that Barrett would just write
                        material. In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit
                        singles to follow up "Arnold Layne" and "See Emily Play", instead introduced "Have You Got It
                        Yet?" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the
                        song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photoshoot of Pink Floyd, the photographs
                        show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance.
                    </p>

                        Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in
                        January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should
                        collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was "Nah, let's not bother", signalling the
                        end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later said, "He was our friend, but most of the
                        time we now wanted to strangle him." In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners
                        Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave.

                        Jenner and King believed Barrett was the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent
                        him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison sold his business to NEMS Enterprises,
                        and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6
                        April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction
                        fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV
                        appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in
                        favour of Waters and Wright material such as "It Would Be So Nice" and "Careful with That Axe,
                        Eugene".

                    <h2>Ummagumma (1969)</h2>

                    <p>
                        Ummagumma represented a departure from Pink Floyd's previous work. Released as a double-LP on
                        EMI's Harvest label, the first two sides contained live performances recorded at Manchester
                        College of Commerce and Mothers, a club in Birmingham. The second LP contained a single
                        experimental contribution from each band member. Ummagumma was released in November 1969 and
                        received positive reviews. The album peaked at number 5, spending 21 weeks on the UK chart.
