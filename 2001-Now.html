                    <h2> 2005–Present: Reunion, deaths, and The Endless River</h2>

                    <h3>Live 8 Reunion</h3>

                    <p>
                        On 2 July 2005, Waters, Gilmour, Mason and Wright performed together as Pink Floyd for the first
                        time in more than 24 years, at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London. The reunion was arranged
                        by Live 8 organiser Bob Geldof; after Gilmour declined the offer, Geldof asked Mason, who
                        contacted Waters. About two weeks later, Waters called Gilmour, their first conversation in two
                        years, and the next day Gilmour agreed. In a statement to the press, the band stressed the
                        unimportance of their problems in the context of the Live 8 event.
                    </p>

                    <img src="imagens/2005 live aid 8-2.jpeg" alt="live 8">

                    <p>
                        They planned their setlist at the Connaught Hotel in London, followed by three days of
                        rehearsals at Black Island Studios. The sessions were problematic, with disagreements over the
                        style and pace of the songs they were practising; the running order was decided on the eve of
                        the event. At the beginning of their performance of "Wish You Were Here", Waters told the
                        audience: "[It is] quite emotional, standing up here with these three guys after all these
                        years, standing to be counted with the rest of you ... we're doing this for everyone who's not
                        here, and particularly of course for Syd." At the end, Gilmour thanked the audience and started
                        to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, and the band shared a group hug. Images of the
                        hug were a favourite among Sunday newspapers after Live 8. Waters said of their almost 20 years
                        of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It
                        was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."

                    <p>
                        Though Pink Floyd turned down a contract worth £136 million for a final tour, Waters did not
                        rule out more performances, suggesting it ought to be for a charity event only. However, Gilmour
                        told the Associated Press that a reunion would not happen: "The [Live 8] rehearsals convinced me
                        [that] it wasn't something I wanted to be doing a lot of ... There have been all sorts of
                        farewell moments in people's lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can
                        fairly categorically say that there won't be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It
                        isn't to do with animosity or anything like that. It's just ... I've been there, I've done it."
                        In February 2006, Gilmour was interviewed for the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, which
                        declared: "Patience for fans in mourning. The news is official. Pink Floyd the brand is
                        dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour
                        responded: "It's over ... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old ... it is much more comfortable to
                        work on my own." Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite.

                    <h3> Deaths of Barrett and Wright </h3>

                    <p>
                        Barrett died on 7 July 2006, at his home in Cambridge, aged 60. His funeral was held at
                        Cambridge Crematorium on 18 July 2006; no Pink Floyd members attended. Wright said: "The band
                        are very naturally upset and sad to hear of Syd Barrett's death. Syd was the guiding light of
                        the early band line-up and leaves a legacy which continues to inspire." Although Barrett had
                        faded into obscurity over the decades, the national press praised him for his contributions to
                        music. On 10 May 2007, Waters, Gilmour, Wright and Mason performed at the Barrett tribute
                        concert "Madcap's Last Laugh" at the Barbican Centre in London. Gilmour, Wright and Mason
                        performed the Barrett compositions "Bike" and "Arnold Layne", and Waters performed a solo
                        version of his song "Flickering Flame".

                    <p>
                        Wright died of an undisclosed form of cancer on 15 September 2008, aged 65. His former bandmates
                        paid tributes to his life and work; Gilmour said: "In the welter of arguments about who or what
                        was Pink Floyd, Rick's enormous input was frequently forgotten. He was gentle, unassuming and
                        private but his soulful voice and playing were vital, magical components of our most recognised
                        Pink Floyd sound." A week after Wright's death, Gilmour performed "Remember a Day" from A
                        Saucerful of Secrets, written and originally sung by Wright, in tribute to him on BBC Two's
                        Later... with Jools Holland. Keyboardist Keith Emerson released a statement praising Wright as
                        the "backbone" of Pink Floyd.

                    <h3>Further performances and rereleases </h3>

                    <p>
                        On 10 July 2010, Waters and Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping
                        Foundation. The event, which raised money for Palestinian children, took place at Kiddington
                        Hall in Oxfordshire, England, with an audience of approximately 200. In return for Waters'
                        appearance at the event, Gilmour performed "Comfortably Numb" at Waters' performance of The Wall
                        at the London O2 Arena on 12 May 2011, singing the choruses and playing the two guitar solos.
                        Mason also joined, playing tambourine for "Outside the Wall" with Gilmour on mandolin.
                        On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the
                        title Why Pink Floyd...?, reissuing the back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including
                        "Experience" and "Immersion" multi-disc multi-format editions. The albums were remastered by
                        James Guthrie, co-producer of The Wall. In November 2015, Pink Floyd released a limited edition
                        EP, 1965: Their First Recordings, comprising six songs recorded prior to The Piper at the Gates
                        of Dawn.

                    <h3> The Endless River (2014) and Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets </h3>

                    <p>
                        In 2012, Gilmour and Mason revisited recordings made with Wright during the Division Bell
                        sessions to create a new Pink Floyd album. They recruited session musicians to help record new
                        parts and "generally harness studio technology". Waters was not involved. Mason described the
                        album as a tribute to Wright: "I think this record is a good way of recognising a lot of what he
                        does and how his playing was at the heart of the Pink Floyd sound. Listening back to the
                        sessions, it really brought home to me what a special player he was."

                    <p>
                        The Endless River was released on 7 November 2014, the second Pink Floyd album distributed by
                        Parlophone following the release of the 20th anniversary editions of The Division Bell earlier
                        in 2014. Though it received mixed reviews, it became the most pre-ordered album of all time on
                        Amazon UK and debuted at number one in several countries. The vinyl edition was the
                        fastest-selling UK vinyl release of 2014 and the fastest-selling since 1997. Gilmour said The
                        Endless River would be Pink Floyd's last album, saying: "I think we have successfully
                        commandeered the best of what there is ... It's a shame, but this is the end." There was no
                        supporting tour, as Gilmour felt it was impossible without Wright. In 2015, Gilmour reiterated
                        that Pink Floyd were "done" and that to reunite without Wright would be wrong. Mason said in
                        2018 that, while he remained close to both, Gilmour and Waters remained "at loggerheads".
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In November 2016, Pink Floyd released a box set, The Early Years 1965–1972, comprising outtakes,
                        live recordings, remixes, and films from their early career. It was followed in December 2019 by
                        The Later Years, compiling Pink Floyd's work after Waters' departure. The set includes a remixed
                        version of A Momentary Lapse of Reason with more contributions by Wright and Mason, and an
                        expanded reissue of the live album Delicate Sound of Thunder. In November 2020, the reissue of
                        Delicate Sound of Thunder was given a standalone release on multiple formats. Pink Floyd's Live
                        at Knebworth 1990 performance, previously released as part of the Later Years box set, was
                        released on CD and vinyl on 30 April.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2018, Mason formed a new band, Nick Mason's Saucerful of Secrets, to perform Pink Floyd's
                        early material. The band includes Gary Kemp of Spandau Ballet and longtime Pink Floyd
                        collaborator Guy Pratt. They toured Europe in September 2018 and North America in 2019. Waters
                        joined the band at the New York Beacon Theatre to perform vocals for "Set the Controls for the
                        Heart of the Sun".
