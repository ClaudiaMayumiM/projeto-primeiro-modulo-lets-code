                    <h1><b>THE BAND</b></h1>
                    <p>Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London in 1964. Gaining an early following as
                        one of the first British psychedelic groups, they were distinguished for their extended
                        compositions,
                        sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows. They became a leading band
                        of
                        the progressive rock genre, cited by some as the greatest progressive rock band of all time.</p>

                    <p>Pink Floyd were founded in 1964 by Syd Barrett (guitar, lead vocals), Nick Mason (drums), Roger
                        Waters
                        (bass guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards, vocals) and Bob Klose (guitars); Klose quit in
                        1965.
                        Under Barrett's leadership, they released two charting singles and the successful debut album
                        The Piper
                        at the Gates of Dawn (1967). Guitarist and vocalist David Gilmour joined in December 1967;
                        Barrett left
                        in April 1968 due to deteriorating mental health. Waters became the primary lyricist and
                        thematic leader,
                        devising the concepts behind the band's peak success with the albums The Dark Side of the Moon
                        (1973),
                        Wish You Were Here (1975), Animals (1977) and The Wall (1979). The musical film based on The
                        Wall,
                        Pink Floyd – The Wall (1982), won two BAFTA Awards.</p>

                    <p>Following personal tensions, Wright left Pink Floyd in 1979, followed by Waters in 1985. Gilmour
                        and
                        Mason continued as Pink Floyd, rejoined later by Wright. The band produced two more albums—A
                        Momentary
                        Lapse of Reason (1987) and The Division Bell (1994)—and toured in support of both albums before
                        entering
                        a long period of inactivity. In 2005, all but Barrett reunited for a one-off performance at the
                        global
                        awareness event Live 8. Barrett died in 2006, and Wright in 2008. The last Pink Floyd studio
                        album, The
                        Endless River (2014), was based on unreleased material from the Division Bell recording
                        sessions.</p>

                    <p>By 2013, Pink Floyd had sold more than 250 million records worldwide, making them one of the
                        best-selling
                        music artists of all time. Wish You Were Here, The Dark Side of the Moon, and The Wall are among
                        the best-selling
                        albums of all time, and the latter two have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.[1] Four
                        of the band's
                        albums topped the US Billboard 200, and five of their albums topped the UK Album Chart. Hit
                        singles produced
                        include "See Emily Play" (1967), "Money" (1973), the three-part composition "Another Brick in
                        the Wall" (1979),
                        "Not Now John" (1983), "On the Turning Away" (1987) and "High Hopes" (1994). The band also
                        composed several
                        film scores. They were inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996 and the UK Music
                        Hall of Fame in 2005.
                        In 2008, King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden presented Pink Floyd with the Polar Music Prize for
                        their contribution to modern music.</p>
